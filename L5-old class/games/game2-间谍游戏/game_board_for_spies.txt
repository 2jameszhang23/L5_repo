Game board (for spies):

1. Cache memory stores frequently used data for faster access.
2. Virtual memory uses hard drive space as if it were RAM.
3. A compiler shows an error report after translating code.
4. USB is used for data transfer between devices.
5. Higher sample rate and resolution = better quality, larger size.
6. HTTP transfers web pages; HTTPS is the secure version.
7. Actuators perform actions based on data (e.g., motors, valves).
8. A web browser retrieves and displays web pages.
9. Sample rate determines how many samples are taken per second.
10. Software interrupts are triggered by program errors.
11. Lossless compression keeps all data (e.g., RLE).
12. A MAC address uniquely identifies a network device.
13. Image and sound file sizes depend on resolution, sample rate, and bit depth.
14. Brute-force attacks try all possible passwords.
15. Text is converted to binary for processing.
16. Sensors capture data (e.g., temperature, pressure).
17. A URL is the web address of a page or resource.
18. Sample resolution refers to the bits used for each sample.
19. A core in a CPU is a unit that can process instructions.
20. Data transmission methods include serial, parallel, and duplex.
21. An interpreter translates code line by line.
22. A check digit validates data (e.g., ISBN, barcode).
23. Lossy compression reduces size by discarding some data (e.g., JPEG, MP3).
24. Echo check sends data back to confirm accuracy.
25. DNS translates URLs into IP addresses.
